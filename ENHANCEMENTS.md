# EMBL-EBI Protein MCP Server Enhancements

## Summary
Based on user feedback about the API being difficult to use, the following enhancements have been implemented to make the MCP server more LLM-friendly and user-friendly.

## 🆕 New Functions Added

### 1. `get_protein_summary` ⭐
**Purpose**: One-stop comprehensive protein lookup
- **Input**: Gene name (e.g., 'p53', 'insulin') + organism (default: 'human')
- **Output**: Complete protein information including:
  - Basic protein details and accession
  - Sequence features and domains
  - Protein interactions
  - Error handling for missing data
- **Usage**: Perfect starting point for any protein research

### 2. `find_protein_accession` 🔍
**Purpose**: Easy protein ID lookup for common names
- **Input**: Gene/protein name + organism
- **Features**:
  - Supports common organism names: human, mouse, rat, yeast, e.coli, drosophila
  - Automatic taxonomy ID mapping
  - Fallback search strategies (gene name → protein name)
- **Usage**: When you need UniProt accession for other functions

## 🔧 Enhanced Tool Descriptions

### Before vs After Examples:

**Before**: 
```
"Search UniProt protein entries"
```

**After**:
```  
"🔍 Search UniProt protein database by text query. Returns proteins that match your search terms in their names, descriptions, or annotations. Use when you want to browse proteins related to a topic."
```

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ **Emojis** for visual recognition
- ✅ **Clear use cases** ("Use when...")
- ✅ **Specific examples** (P04637 for human p53)
- ✅ **Workflow guidance** (RECOMMENDED FIRST STEP)
- ✅ **Parameter explanations** with valid ranges and defaults

## 🗺️ Organism Name Mapping

Added support for common organism names instead of requiring taxonomy IDs:

| Common Name | Taxonomy ID | 
|-------------|-------------|
| human       | 9606        |
| mouse       | 10090       |
| rat         | 10116       |
| yeast       | 559292      |
| e.coli      | 83333       |
| drosophila  | 7227        |

## 🎯 LLM-Friendly Features

### 1. **Clear Workflow Guidance**
- `get_protein_summary` marked as "BEST STARTING POINT"
- `find_protein_accession` marked as "RECOMMENDED FIRST STEP"
- Tool descriptions explain when to use each function

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Graceful fallbacks when searches fail
- Informative error messages
- Partial results when some data is unavailable

### 3. **Examples in Descriptions**
- Tool descriptions include concrete examples
- Parameter descriptions show valid inputs
- Expected output formats explained

## 📊 Tool Count Summary

- **Before**: 28 tools
- **After**: 30 tools (2 new helper functions)
- **Enhanced**: All tool descriptions improved
- **New workflow**: Easy protein lookup → detailed analysis

## 🚀 Usage Recommendations

### For LLMs:
1. **Start with** `get_protein_summary` for comprehensive protein info
2. **Use** `find_protein_accession` when you only need the UniProt ID
3. **Follow** the workflow hints in tool descriptions
4. **Leverage** organism name mapping for easier queries

### For Developers:
1. **New functions** handle complex multi-step lookups automatically
2. **Enhanced error handling** provides better user experience  
3. **Consistent JSON responses** for easier parsing
4. **Organism mapping** reduces taxonomy ID lookup overhead

## 🔍 Testing Results

The enhanced server successfully:
- ✅ Registers all 30 tools correctly
- ✅ Provides improved descriptions with examples
- ✅ Handles protein name → accession lookup
- ✅ Supports organism name mapping
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Runs without errors in MCP protocol

## 🎉 Impact

These enhancements transform the EMBL-EBI protein database from a technical API requiring specific knowledge into an LLM-friendly interface that:

- **Reduces complexity** for common use cases
- **Provides clear guidance** on which tools to use when
- **Handles the "identifier problem"** automatically
- **Offers comprehensive protein summaries** in one call
- **Makes protein research more accessible** to non-experts

The server is now much more suitable for use with LLMs and provides a better user experience for protein database queries.
